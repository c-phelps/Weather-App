## Purpose of this repo
To create a weather app that shows today's forecast along side of a 5 day average forecast. When a user input's a valid city, the city's weather and forecast will be displayed and a button storing the search criteria will be appended to the are below the search button. When a user clicks on one of the city buttons below the search button, the weather data for that city will be displayed. In the 5day cards, the temperatue, wind and humidity values are averages for that day and the icon dispalys the expected weather a noon (12 PM).
